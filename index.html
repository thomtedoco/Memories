        <h2>How It All Began</h2>
        <p>It all started when I spotted her... laughing with a dog that clearly had better game than me. She was goofy, charming, and a little wild—and I knew right then I had two options: impress her or let the dog outshine me. Spoiler alert: I still think the dog won, but I got the girl.</p>

                <h3>Montmorency Falls</h3>
                <p>There we were, standing hand in hand at Montmorency Falls, the mist kissing our faces as the water roared behind us. Surrounded by family, laughter echoed louder than the falls themselves. We weren’t just admiring the view—we were part of it. Every smile, every playful shove, and every goofy photo captured more than just a moment; it captured the love and chaos that makes family so unforgettable. And somewhere between dodging water spray and sharing snacks, we realized this was more than just a trip—it was a beautiful chapter in our story</p>

                <h3>First Christmas together with her Family</h3>
                <p>Our first Christmas at her house was filled with love and
                     warmth. Diana was happily caring for baby Carli, while daddy Ariel is always hungry. 
                     Marilou’s kind presence made me feel welcome, and 
                     Jessa, despite always being busy with calls, joined in to celebrate.Tita Elsa prepared 
                     the most delicious food, bringing everyone together. Being surrounded by 
                     her family, I felt truly grateful. In that moment, I knew I was exactly 
                     where I was meant to be..</p>
